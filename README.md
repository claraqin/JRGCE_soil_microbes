The code in this repository reproduces the results of Qin et al. (2019), using data that is available on Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nf481q8. Please note that the code takes as input the OTU tables for fungi and bacteria in .biom format. It does not process raw Illumina reads (.fastq files); however, these raw reads are available from the authors by request.
